# Team Work Cycles

DACS currently operates on two week work cycles beginning on a Monday and ending on the Friday of the Second week. Each work cycle is structured around a particular theme. Generally work cycles are devoted to issues attached to projects supporting a single application (i.e. Orangelight), but in certain instances can involve issues from many projects (i.e. a sprint focused on issues tagged as relevant to security or maintanence).

## Quarterly Planning of Work Cycles
Every quarter the DACS team meets and agrees on an outline and order of sprint themes for the upcoming quarter. This schedule can be adjusted or re-ordered as business needs shift during the course of the quarter. Upcoming sprints and the longer term list of projects they are pulled from can be found in the [DACS Airtable Board](https://airtable.com/appUKFuI9pTitjLfW/tbltAtvtqiUAGq5J1/viwYXLhBlChJEdIar?blocks=hide).
