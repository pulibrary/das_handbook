## Technical Discussions
We reserve an hour a week on Friday for a technical discussion. This can be an experimental topic, a demonstration of a new tool, or an extension of work on an existing ticket that would benefit from the entire team's input. This is an informal meeting where the only requirement is that we focus on technology and code. 

##  Ad Hoc Meetings
Sometimes it is necessary to schedule ad hoc meetings. When doing so please be mindful of the following suggestions:

* Provide a buffer btw the next half hourly increment and the meeting being scheduled
* Generally meetings will be 25 or 50 minutes.
