Pull Requests (PR) are the means by developers propose changes to a project's code.

* All code changes should be introduced via Github's pull request mechanism. If you want the review of a particular team member please tag them when creating the PR.
* The default branch PRs are created against is a project's "main" git branch. 
* Pull Requests can be created in "Draft" or "Ready for Review". Use Draft if you would like a team member's input but do not think the code is ready for addition to the main branch of a project. Mark the PR as "Ready for Review" when you believe it is ready for to be merged into the main branch. 
* A team member should not merge a pull request they've submitted until another team member has approved it. 
* You can find PRs in the Review/QA column of our [Zenhub Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/feature-work-cycle-board-571691cab409d8d821b873be/board)
